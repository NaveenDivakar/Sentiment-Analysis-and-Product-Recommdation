"Google Pixel 8 (Hazel, 256 GB) Reviews",I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied. Display is great but less contrasty so you feel washed out colour after switching from old phone. I am getting 6 to 7 hrs of SOT with a new software update. The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues. Go for it if you are not a gamer.,5
"Google Pixel 8 (Hazel, 256 GB) Reviews","Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price.
Pros:-

Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you wi...

"Google Pixel 8 (Hazel, 256 GB) Reviews","The phone is excellent. No heating, but it does get ever so slightly warm but no where close to how hot tensor G1 and G2 got.performance is top notch.

"Google Pixel 8 (Hazel, 256 GB) Reviews","Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone)
The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples.
The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures.
The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays att...

"Google Pixel 8 (Hazel, 256 GB) Reviews","What you'll like:
- Great pics.. no matter what the lighting. Came here from an S22 Ultra. Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!!
- 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics.
- Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight.
- Slick haptics
- Battery lasts an entire day
- Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS.
- Superb value if bought during the sale.

There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.

I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although the...
